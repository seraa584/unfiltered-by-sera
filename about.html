            <h2>About Sera Anna Aby & The Unfiltered Project</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is <b>Sera Anna Aby</b>, and I'm a high school student with a deep passion for <b>neuroscience</b> and its application to social issues. My goal is to educate the public on forgotten issues by exploring the complex patterns of human behavior and societal pressures that affect the brain and mind.</p>
            
            <h3>My Mission</h3>
            <p>The mission of <b>UnfilteredBySera</b> is to peel back the layers on hidden and overlooked social issues and analyze them through a unique lens, combining rigorous reporting with principles of <b>psychology, neurobiology, and data analysis</b>.</p>

            <p>This space is dedicated to using analytical writing—like my work on <a href="https://medium.com/@seraa21">Medium</a>—to advocate for informed, empathetic solutions. By breaking down complex social dynamics into observable patterns and neural responses, I hope to offer perspectives that encourage deeper understanding and meaningful action.</p>
            
            <h3>Connect</h3>
            <p>Thank you for exploring this project. Your feedback and engagement are welcome!</p>
